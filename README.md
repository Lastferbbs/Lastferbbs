# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jakub

### I strongly believe decentralization and transparency can make world better place. That's why I want to be involved in shaping future cryptoworld.

After I wake up, brush my teeth, wash my face I sit at my desk, turn on my monitors and I look at my plan for today, most if not all of my points involve programming.

Don't make me trust you, show me (cryptographic) proof :)

### At the moment mostly busy with bettering my skills in Python, Solidity and Vyper. Also interested in learning Go, Rust and other "blockchain" languages.
